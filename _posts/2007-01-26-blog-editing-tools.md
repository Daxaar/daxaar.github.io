I've just downloaded a Firefox blog editor extension called Performancing.&nbsp; It sits in the status bar on Firefox and pops up a basic editor when clicked.&nbsp; I can see this being really useful for dropping on quick posts whilst browsing.<br /><br />As I've posted this entry using the tool I guess you could call this a test entry therefore name your drink here...<br /><br />powered by <a href="http://performancing.com/firefox">performancing firefox</a><br />
