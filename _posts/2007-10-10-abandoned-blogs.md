If a place existed where blogs could go when feeling neglected, I'd say mine would have been there for quite some time!

Having been really busy over the last 9 months building a new .NET solution I've now returned to TFS to perform some "housekeeping" in preperation of our next project.  Actually when I say housekeeping it's a little more serious than that; I've actually built us a whole new TFS Server as the last one had to remain in a Workgroup due to the lack of an AD in our environment.  As you can probably imagine being in a Workgroup proved to be quite a pain at times especially with Build Server and SPS.  But hey, we're on the road to recovery so I'll be posting more TFS findings and pains on here over time.
