title: Choosing an Express Stack
excerpt: "Too much choice really isn't a good thing"

For some time now I've been dabbling with express.  Nothing commercial but gaining enough knowledge to start edging towards competent.  One of the things I often wonder is how many teams actually start a new project with express from scratch with an `npm install express` or `express init` depending on your express flavour?  Does a new project really start here or would most developments teams start with their own internal pre-baked express install containing all the common middleware they'll use such as passport etc?

If they don't follow this model how many choose to move slightly further up the abstraction chain and look at frameworks that sit on top of express such as MEAN or Sails.  For me it seems that if you're going angular and mongo, MEAN is a no brainer but Sails doesn't preclude this stack either.  Choices choices...

This post will be updated further as I discover more.
