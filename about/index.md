I'm an independent software consultant from the UK.  I spend the majority of my time nowadays bending http to my will through the use of various static and dynamic languages on both the Microsoft and Open Source platforms.

Generally happiest in a terminal window.  I love the ubiquity of JavaScript and the maturity of C# but neither compare favourably when the opportunity to ride a motorcycle presents itself.
