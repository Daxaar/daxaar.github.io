For anyone who's moved across to Visual Studio 2010 I highly recommend taking a look at the online gallery of extensions under Tools -&gt; Extension Manager.

Even at this early point in the products release there are some excellent extensions available. In particular Pro Power Tools. This adds various productivity enhancements of which the most awesome is the search feature added to the Add Reference dialog.

Go check them out. But careful, it's difficult to stop once you start! :)
