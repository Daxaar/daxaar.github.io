Every now and again I like to check in on what's trending on GitHub.&nbsp; When you get a spare five minutes <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/explore">take a look</a>, I think you'll find it quite useful, even perhaps a little entertaining.<br /><br />This morning I came across <a target="_blank" href="http://josscrowcroft.github.com/accounting.js/">accounting.js</a>.&nbsp; Whilst I don't have an immediate need for this one I can see it being something I'll definitely be considering in the future.&nbsp; Click through for more info but essentially it's a javascript library for formatting financials.&nbsp; In particular I like the formatColumn() function that provides various padding functionality for tabular data.&nbsp; Nice work Joss.<br />
