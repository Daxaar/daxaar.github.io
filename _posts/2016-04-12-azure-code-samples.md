We're certainly not short of demo solutions and todo apps but I was pleased to receive an email today with details on the now comprehensive list of Azure code samples available for download <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/samples">here</a>.

Of particular interest to me are the identity management and authentication samples I'll be hooking into Dynamics CRM 2016 and of course anything node related will always get my attention.
