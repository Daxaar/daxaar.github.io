Having now watched the keynotes and a couple of sessions from <a href="http://buildwindows.com" target="_blank">Build</a> (sans whacks) I've found myself still confused about how the new stack built around WinRT hangs together.  Has my recent effort to spend some quality time with javascript on the assumption that it'll become far more prevalent come to fruition or should I be hanging my hat with the XAML brigade or maybe I need to brush up on my C++?  The answers to these and many more questions remain unanswered but the following <a href="http://dougseven.com/2011/09/15/a-bad-picture-is-worth-a-thousand-long-discussions/" target="_blank">article by Doug Seven </a>goes a long way to helping me push past the marketing hype.  His article is worth a read if only for the "marketecture" reference.
