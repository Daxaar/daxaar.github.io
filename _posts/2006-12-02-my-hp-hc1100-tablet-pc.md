This is probably as sad as it gets but I'm writing this blog on my new (to me anyway) TC1100 HP tablet.   Having only ever experienced handwriting recognition on a PDA the accuracy of the tablet is incredible!

Unlike most tablet pc's which are just a laptop with a swivel display, the HP is a hybrid as it has a detachable screen so works like either a laptop or a slate.  This makes it ideal for meetings etc as you don't feel like a fool carrying a full laptop into the room.

Couple this device with Microsoft OneNote and you get real productivity  and having just upgraded to office 2007 I can use the rather neat new feature of sending the content of any office document straight to this blog.

If you're in the market for a tablet PC I highly recommend the HP.  Although this particular model has now been removed from the product line and replaced with the TC4400.  This has a higher hardware spec but it's not a hybrid so I think the TC1100 has the makings of a classic. Pick one up on ebay now whilst you still can!

If you would like any more info on the HP, feel free to get in touch.
