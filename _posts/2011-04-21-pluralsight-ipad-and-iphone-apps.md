<p>I'm now into my second year as a Pluralsight customer and overall I've been hugely impressed with the quality of their online training material.  The only pain point I've felt was the lack of an online player that worked on the iPad.  I was therefore delighted today to find out via Twitter (@Pluralsight) that they've just released an iPhone and iPad app.  Having just spun up both versions I was delighted to see once logged in that it tracks my watched content just like the website and most importantly lets me watch the entire online catalogue through the iPad.  Bingo!
</p><p>I'll probably continue to download the videos and sync into iTunes for offline viewing but this ability to watch anywhere I have net access without needing to sync and manage the limited space I have left on my iPad has removed that final pain point for me in my online training.  Good job Pluralsight, keep it up.</p>
