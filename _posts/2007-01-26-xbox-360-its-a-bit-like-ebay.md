Having picked one up before Christmas I can now say I am officially hooked.  My poor wife has become an Xbox widow and the kids haven't eaten for a week due to my choosing between buying food or Gears of War.<br /><br />I've played the odd game in the past whether on a console or PC but never really got into it.  I'm sure like my kids I've got A.D.D and therefore a game needs to grab me from the first seconds of play and keep hold for a decent amount of time.  So far the two games to deliver on this are Gears of War and Project Gotham Racing 3.<br /><br />If you've read this far you're probably wondering where the eBay reference comes from.  Well, Xbox live has achievements and eBay has feedback.  Both of which I've been/am a victim of pursuing with an unhealthy relentlessness.<br />
