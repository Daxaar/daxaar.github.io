In my search for an answer to this problem I came across <a href="http://www.richard-banks.org/2010/07/how-to-versioning-builds-with-tfs-2010.html" target="_blank">this blog post</a> that provides excellent detail on customisation of the Default Process Template for creating auto incrementing builds on your build server.  Nice work Richard.
